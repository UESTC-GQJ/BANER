# BANER
This is the source code of COLING 2025 paper BANER: Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition.

## What is BANER ðŸ‘€
This paper proposes a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLMâ€™s ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, BANER utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities![image](framework.pdf)

### Local Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

    abstract = "Despite the recent success of two-stage prototypical networks in few-shot named entity recognition (NER), challenges such as over/under-detected false spans in the span detection stage and unaligned entity prototypes in the type classification stage persist. Additionally, LLMs have not proven to be effective few-shot information extractors in general. In this paper, we propose an approach called Boundary-Aware LLMs for Few-Shot Named Entity Recognition to address these issues. We introduce a boundary-aware contrastive learning strategy to enhance the LLM`s ability to perceive entity boundaries for generalized entity spans. Additionally, we utilize LoRAHub to align information from the target domain to the source domain, thereby enhancing adaptive cross-domain classification capabilities. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms prior methods, validating its effectiveness. In particular, the proposed strategies demonstrate effectiveness across a range of LLM architectures. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/BANER."
